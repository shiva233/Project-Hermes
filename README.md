# Project-Hermes

> Hermes (n.): God of speed, travel, and messangers. In this incarnation he carries pixels instead of scrolls, streaming your games from your desktop to your hands.

Project Hermes is a handheld "console" designed for people who already own gaming PCs so they can stream their games via SteamLink so they can take it anywhere for cheap!
